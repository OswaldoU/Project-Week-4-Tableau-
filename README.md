# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
Analyze and provide insightful data visualizations from Fifa 18 database. 

## Process
1) Extract and load fifa 18 database onto tableau desktop
2) Clean data and appropriately format columns into correct data types (ex. Nationaity --> Geographical)
3) Set data heirarchies to improve robustness and organization of dataset
4) Vizualize data and set dashboard on Tableau
## Results
The main premise behind this project was to assume the role of the owner of a new football club (ex. Lighthouse F.C.). The central question that arises when going through this thought exercise would be which players would the team recruit and why? 

As a new owner, financial constraints would lie high on the list of priorities. That being the case, the best players for our club would be determined based on a ratio of price to performance. The first inquiry would be made on the entire market of players to see which countries have the biggest accruals of talent and player value on the global scale. Next we have to narrow the search by clustering player groups by independent variables such as overall, age, and potential. 

As a result we have grouped players into three groups (developing players, developed players, and players past their prime), of which, developing players seem to be the most lucrative. Lastly, we want to focus our search further by looking at the countries that on average offer the lowest valuations and contracted wages on their developing players. Thus, we can see that countries like Mali, Morocco, Venezuela, and Argentina will offer us the best bang for buck for our investments on potential players. 

## Challenges 
One challenge that I came across was the lack of time centered data found in the dataset. This limited the ability to forecast future trends in the footballer market that would further enhance our insights and conclusions. 

## Future Goals
If I had more time, I would definitely look to do the standard project outline or the airbnb project. This project was fun to complete but I believe those other projects would produce yield real world application.
